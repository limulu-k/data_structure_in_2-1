### Set Theory

Infinites set

- N : a set of natural numbers(자연수)
- Q : a set of rational numbers(유리수)
- R : a set of real number(실수)

Cardinality : 집합의 크기

Prove **|N| = |Q|**

1. **|N| ≤ |Q|**

   N ⊆ Q 따라서 |N| ≤ |Q|

2. **|N| ≥ |Q|**

   Q<sub>E</sub> = {1/1, 2/1, 2/2}

   Q ⊆ Q<sub>E</sub>

   |Q<sub>E</sub>| = |N|

   Q ⊆ N 따라서 |N| ≥ |Q|

3. 따라서 |N| = |Q|

Prove **|N| < |R|**

suppose R = {x | 0<x<1} is enumerable

0.a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>a<sub>3</sub>a<sub>4</sub>

0.b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>b<sub>3</sub>b<sub>4</sub>

...



x = 0.x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>x<sub>3</sub>x<sub>4</sub>

x<sub>1</sub> != a<sub>1</sub>

x<sub>2</sub> != b<sub>2</sub>

....

then x !∈ R

it is not enumerable so contradiction and |N|<|R|



### Transfinite numbers

ℵ(aleph)

ℵ<sub>0</sub> : Countably infinite

|R| = 2<sup>ℵ<sub>0</sub></sup> = ℵ<sub>0</sub>

General **C**ontinuum **H**ypothesis

ℵ<sub>i+1</sub> = 2<sup>ℵ<sub>i</sub></sup>



Godel proved that it is consistent if we assume CH is true.

P. Cohen proved that it is consistent if we assume CH is false.



### Russell's Paradox

Naive set theory is flawed.

if R = {x | x !∈ x}

- if R is not a meber of itself, then it shoud be a member of it
- if R is  a member of itself, it should not be a member of it.

R ∈ R => R !∈ R

 => the barber of seville(cf by Rossinis' Opera)

Principia mathematica



### Godel incompleteness theroem

Any consistent formal system F with a  certaion amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete.

In other words, **there always exists some statements p that can neither be proved nor disporved in F**.



### Entscheidungsproblem

Devise an algorithm to decide if a polynomial has an integral root

Diophantine equation

D = {p | p is a polynomial with an integral root}



D<sub>1</sub> = {p | p is a polynomial over x with an integral root}

**Decidable Language**

A Language L is deciable if there exists a TM recognizing L, that stops on every input.



1. Deciding wheter A<sub>DFA</sub>(DFA accept language)
2. Deciding wheter A<sub>NFA</sub>
3. Deciding wheter A<sub>REX</sub>
4. Deciding wheter E<sub>DFA</sub>(DFA accept empty language)
5. Deciding wheter EQ<sub>DFA</sub>
6. Deciding wheter A<sub>CFG</sub>
7. Deciding wheter E<sub>CFG</sub>
8. Undeciding wheter EQ<sub>CFG</sub>
9. Deciding wheter E<sub>CFL</sub>



### A<sub>DFA</sub> is Decidable

A<sub>DFA</sub> = {<B, w> | B is a  DFA accepting w}

M = "on Input <B,w>:

1. Simulate B on input w
2. If the Tm that simulates B ends in and accept state then accept, otherwise reject"



### A<sub>NFA</sub> is Decidable

A<sub>NFA</sub> = {<B,w> | B is a NFA accepting w}

N = "on input <B,w>:

1. Convert NFA B to an equivalent DFA C.
2. Run TM from M on inpuc <C,w>
3. If M Accpets-accept, othersiwe-reject"



### A<sub>REX</sub> is Decidable

A<sub>REX</sub> = {<R,w> | R is an RE generating w}

P = "On input <R,w>:

1. Convert RE R to an equivalent NFA A
2. Run TM N on <A,w>
3. if N accepts-accept, Otherwise-reject."



### E<sub>DFA</sub> is decidable

E<sub>DFA</sub> = {< A > | A is a DFA and L(A) = ∅}

T = "On input < A >:

1. Mark the start state of A
2. Repeat until no new states are marked
3. Mark any state that has an incoming transition from an already marked state
4. If no accept state is marked-accept, Otherwise reject."

### 

### EQ<sub>DFA</sub> is decidable

DEQ<sub>DFA</sub> = {<A,B> | A and B are DFA and L(A) = L(B)}

Symmetric difference

L(C) = (L(A)∩L(B)<sup>C</sup>)∪(L(A)<sup>C</sup>∩L(B))

L(C) = ∅ iff L(A) = L(B)

**??????**



###  A<sub>CFG</sub> is decidable

A<sub>CFG</sub> = {<G,w> | G is a CFG generating w}

A CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form if every rule is of the form:

A -> BC

A -> a

S = "On input<G,w>:

1. Convert G to an euivlanet CNF grammar.
2. List all derivations with 2n-1 steps, where n is the length of w, except if n =0, then instead list all derivations with one step
3. **?????????**



### E<sub>CFG</sub> is decidable

E<sub>CFG</sub> = {< G >| G is a CFG and L(G) = ∅}

M = "On input < G >, where G is a CFG:

1. MArk all terminal symbols in G

2. Rpeat until no new variables are marked

3. Mark any variable A where G has a rule of the form

   A -> U<sub>1</sub>U<sub>2</sub>.....U<sub>k</sub> and U<sub>1</sub>U<sub>2</sub>.....U<sub>k</sub> are all marked.

4. if the start variable is not marked accept, otherwise reject."



### EQ<sub>CFG</sub> is undecidable language.

EQ<sub>CFG</sub> = {<G,H> | G,H are CFG and L(G) = L(H)}

ex) 

A = {A<sup>m</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>n</sup> | m,n>0}

B = {A<sup>m</sup>B<sup>m</sup>C<sup>n</sup> | m,n>0}

A∩B = {A<sup>m</sup>B<sup>m</sup>C<sup>m</sup>| m,n>0} ≠ ∅



### Every<sub>CFL</sub> is decidable

Suppose L is a CFL

Suppose G is a CFG that generates L.

Suppose there is a TM M<sub>G</sub> that decides L.

M<sub>G</sub> = "On input w:

1. Run TM S on input <G,w>
2. If S accept-accept, Otherwise-reject"





regular ⊆ context-free ⊆ decidable ⊆ Turing-recognizable



f: A->B

f is one to one function

f is onto function

if there exists such a correspondence function f, then |A| = |B|



|N| = |Even N| = ℵ<sub>0</sub>

|E∪O| = |E|+ |O| = ℵ<sub>0</sub>+ℵ<sub>0</sub> = 2ℵ<sub>0 </sub>?



### Countable Set

if set of A is finite A is countable

|N|(ℵ<sub>0</sub>) is countable because it is enumerable.

|Q| is countable => ℵ<sub>0</sub>

​	start counting from the upper left corner and continue in this fashion



### Uncountable set

IBS(infinite binary sequence),|R|



#### There are some languages that not Turing-recognizable

1. the set of all string is countable => **|Σ<sup>*</sup>| = ℵ<sub>0</sub>**

2. the set of all turing machines is countable => **T ⊆ |Σ<sup>*</sup>|**

3. the set of all languages is uncountable => **|L| > ℵ<sub>0</sub>**

4. there is not a correspondence function between TM, L

   => f: TM -> L, 

5. Thus, there must be some languages that are not recognizeable.

​	

##### 1. the set of all string is countable 

Σ = {0,1}

Σ<sup>*</sup> = {"", 0,1,00,01,10,11,,,,,}

​     = {1,n<sup>1</sup>,n<sup>2</sup>,,,,} => enumerable so countable



##### 2. the set of all turing machines is countable 

T<sub>i</sub> is noting buy a  finite sequence of binary digits.

T<sub>i</sub>  = <Q,Σ,gamma, delta, q0, qa,qr>

Q = {q0, q1,q2,,,,qa,qr} => {1,11,111,1111,,,,} => enumerable => countable

Σ⊆gamma => {1,11,111,1111,,,,} => countable

L, R => 1,11

delta => delta(q,a) = (q,b,L) =use 0 for delimeter> 10101101101

​	delta(), delta() =use 00 for delimeter> delta()00delta()

so <T<sub>i</sub>> is finite seq of binary digits => T<sub>i</sub> ∈Σ<sup>*</sup> => T ⊆ Σ\*

결론 if makes some turing machin T it can make to binary sequence that member of Σ<sup>*</sup> so it is enumerable so countable

##### 3. the set of all languages is uncountable

Σ<sup>*</sup> = {"", 0, 1, 00, 01, ,,,}

A = {0,01,,,,}

X<sub>A</sub> = {0 1 0 0 1,,,} <- characterize A

Let L as a set of all Infinite binary sequence, then it is uncountable

|L| > ℵ<sub>0</sub>



### A<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable

1. A<sub>TM</sub> = {<M,w> | M is a TM that accept w}

=> w ∈ L, M accepts w

​      w !∈ L, ?

2. Suppose H is a TM that decide A<sub>TM</sub>(A<sub>TM</sub> is decidable)

​	=> H(<M,w>) is accept if M accept w, reject if M does not accept w

3. Define TM D, that uses H as follow

   D = "On input < M > where M is a TM:

     1. run H on input <M, < M >>

     2. Output the opposite of H's output namely

        => if H accepts, then reject

        ​      if H rejects, then accept"

=> D(< M >) = accept if M rejects < M >

​		        reject if m accept < M >



D(< D >) = accept if D rejects < D >

​		   reject if D accept < D >

So if D accepts, it rejects and if it rejects, it accepts. it is condratiction

becase by assumtion that A<sub>TM</sub> is decidable.



1. Define A<sub>TM</sub> = {<M,w> | M is a TM that accept w}
2. Assume that A<sub>TM</sub> is decidabl and let H be a TM deciding it
3. Use H to build TM D that gets a string and behaves exactly opposite to H's behavipr
4. Run D on its encoding < D > and conclude D(< D >)



###  A<sub>TM</sub><sup>C</sup> is not Turing recognizable

∀w ∈ L and M accept w, L is T-Recognizable, L<sup>C</sup> is co-T-Recognizable



Suppose L is decidable, iff it is T-recognizable and co-T-recognizable



If L is decidable so is its complement L<sup>C</sup>



**L is decidable == L is T-recognizable & co-T-recognizable**

1. A<sub>TM</sub> is T-R

2. Assume A<sub>TM</sub><sup>C</sup> is T-R, Then A<sub>TM</sub> is co-T-R.

3. Then A<sub>TM</sub> is decidable, but it is contradiction. So A<sub>TM</sub><sup>C</sup> is not T-R



Regular L : {A<sup>m</sup>| m>=0}

CFL : {A<sup>m</sup>B<sup>m</sup>| m>=0}

Deciadable : {A<sup>m</sup>B<sup>m</sup>C<sup>m</sup>| m>=0}

T-R : A<sub>TM</sub>



## Reduction

A ∝B

A is reducible to B(the reductions is form A to B)

if B is decidable, A is decidable

if A is un decidable, B is undecidable



### HALT<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable

HALT<sub>TM</sub> = {<M,w> | M is TM and M halts on input w}

A<sub>TM</sub> ∝ HALT<sub>TM</sub>

Suppose HALT<sub>TM</sub> is decidable,

and R decides HALT<sub>TM</sub>

S = "On input <M, w> where M is a TM:

 	1. Run R on input <M,w> until i halts
 	2. if R rejects(M loops on w)-reject
 	3. Simulate M on w until it halts
 	4. if M accepts-accept, otherwise reject"

​	=> A<sub>TM</sub> ∝ HALT<sub>TM</sub>

​	=> S decides A<sub>TM</sub> is made but it is contradiction so R is undecidable 

​		=> HALT<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable



### E<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable

E<sub>TM</sub> = {< M > | M is a TM and L(M) = ∅}

A<sub>TM</sub> ∝ E<sub>TM</sub>

1. Suppose R is a decider for E<sub>TM</sub>
2. If its able to construct a TM S that decides A<sub>TM</sub>, this is contradiction
3. Thus we should conclude that R does not exit. 



L(M<sub>1</sub>) = {w} if M accepts w, ∅ if M reject w

M<sub>1</sub> = "On input x:

1. if x ≠ w, reject
2. if x = w, run M on w and accept if M accepts w"



S = "On input <M,w> where M is a TM:

1. Use a description of M and w to construct the TM M<sub>1</sub>
2. Run R on input <M<sub>1</sub>>
3. if R accepts, then reject
4. if R rejects, then accept"

​	=> A<sub>TM</sub> ∝ E<sub>TM</sub>

​	=> S decides A<sub>TM</sub> is made but it is contradiction so R is undecidable 

​		=> E<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable



### REGULAR<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable

REGULAR<sub>TM</sub> = {< M > | M is a TM and L(M) is a regular language}

A<sub>TM</sub> ∝ REGULAR<sub>TM</sub>

L(M<sub>2</sub>) = {0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>}, if M does not accept w, 

​		Σ<sup>*</sup>, if M accept w 

M<sub>2</sub> = "On input x:

1. if x has the form of 0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>, accept
2. if x does not have this form, run M on input accept x if M accepts w "



S = "On input <M,w> where M is a TM on w:

1.  Use a description of M and w to construct M<sub>2</sub>
2. Run R on input <M<sub>2</sub>>
3. if R accecpt then accept, rejects thne reject"

​	=> A<sub>TM</sub> ∝ REGULAR<sub>TM</sub>

​	=> S decides A<sub>TM</sub> is made but it is contradiction so R is undecidable 

​		=> E<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable



### EQ<sub>TM</sub> is udecidable

EQ<sub>CFG</sub> = {<M<sub>1</sub>,M<sub>2</sub>> | M<sub>1</sub>,M<sub>2</sub> are TM and L(M<sub>1</sub>) = L(M<sub>2</sub>)}

E<sub>TM</sub> ∝ EQ<sub>TM</sub>

Suppose there is a TM R that decides EQ<sub>TM</sub>

S = "On input < M >, where M is a TM:

1. Run R on input <M, M<sub>1</sub>> where M<sub>1</sub> is a TM that reject all inputs

2. if R accepts then accept, if R rejects then reject"

   => E<sub>TM</sub> ∝ EQ<sub>TM</sub>

​	=> S can decide E<sub>TM</sub> but it is contradiction, so EQ<sub>TM</sub> is undecidable
